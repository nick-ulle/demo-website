# Creating A Website

## GitHub Pages

Once you've created a website, the next step is to make your website available
online so that other people can visit.

A computer that's online and responds to requests from visitors is called a
_server_.

Most personal computers don't respond to requests from visitors, so they aren't
servers. It's a lot of work to set up a server, and an incorrect setup will
make the server vulnerable to attackers. Rather than set up your computer as a
server, a better option is to use a _host_. Think of a host as a server
service. You upload your website (or other files) to the host's server, and
then anyone can visit that server to see your site.

GitHub provides free hosting, called GitHub Pages, for simple websites. They
even have [instructions to get started][gh-pages].
